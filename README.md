gevent-socketio-sample
=======================

POC for gevent-socketio in Django

1. pip install django==1.6 psycopg2 psycogreen

2. TODO Alter socketio_runserver to remove postgres dependencies

3. Right now, only socketio client 0.9.6 and below is working (for me) [gevent, libevent are latest]

4. gevent-socketio from version 1.0 onwards uses libenv and not libevent, check if that is an issue

5. TO BE USED LOCALLY, FOR PROD NEED SOME MORE CHANGES - TO ADD LATER
